# AIspace
These tools are for learning and exploring concepts in artificial intelligence. They were developed at the [Laboratory for Computational Intelligence](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci) at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/) under direction of [Alan Mackworth](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mack/) and [David Poole](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/). They are part of the online resources for [Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents](http://artint.info). If you are teaching or learning about AI, you may use these tools under the terms of use. Feedback is welcome. 

This project is intended to be an expansion and companion to the existing [AIspace project](www.aispace.org).


In order to run the project you should download the code base from the [AIFCA website](http://artint.info/code/python/) and then place the project files into that same directory. Any files with the same name should be overwritten. Note that this will make running the code base on its own no longer function in some cases.

The project also requires Jupyter Notebooks, and enabling ipywidgets.

You may click on the badge to launch the project in a Binder [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/aispace-developers/aispace)
