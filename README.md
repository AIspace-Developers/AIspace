# AIspace
A series of applets and programs that vizualize how algorithms run in order to aid in learning about AI

This project is intended to be an expansion and companion to the existing <a href="www.aispace.org">AIspace project</a>.

We use the algorithm code from <a href="http://artint.info">"Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Compuational Agents"</a>, a free e-text book in development by David Poole and Alan Mackworth.

In order to run the project, you should download the code base from their website and then place the project files into that same directory. Any files with the same name should be overwritten. Note that this will make running the code base on its own no longer function in some cases.

The project requires Jupyter Notebooks.
